<p> This page is full of pictures that I take on a whim. There is little structure to what Ill take a photo of. Like most people I try to capture photos that remind people of something. Most of the pictures I took are not too personal and try to capture a setting that I think everyone somewhat relates to. A picture of a streetlight at night, a picture of a bundle of clouds. Things that, for the most part are something everyone sees. There's something nostalgic about the things that I want to capture and I wonder if other people can see that.</p>
